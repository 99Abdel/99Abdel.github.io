       This page demonstrates the use of 'extended' Date objects.
       A file named DateMethodsMore.js contains 'self-made' methods
       that can be used with Date objects. For example, there is a
       method named get_distance_to() that can be used to calculate
       the chronological distance between two Date objects.
